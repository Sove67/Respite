# Respite
An as-of-yet unfinished top down wave defense survival game. The successor to the now abandoned '[Physics-Zombie-Game](https://github.com/Sove67/Physics-Zombie-Game)' project.

## Features
- Fully textured and rigged player character
- Modeled and textured buildings
- Exterior *and* interior building generation
- Hunting logic, in addition to the existing Boid wander state for enemies.
- Player defense creation
  - A custom radial selection menu
  - Timing with enumeration
  - Defense selection libraries
  - Custom 'magic' sprites

## Dev Log
The majority of the work I did on this project was documented on my Youtube channel 'Sovereign Realm' in the playlist [Respite](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL314_0jICJf9q3P-g0nuggDUCJBIibraF)
